// Chain-reconciled accounting. The ON-CHAIN payout history is the source of
// truth, not an optimistic in-memory counter. The pool persists only the
// cumulative `Earned` per miner; how much was actually paid is read back from
// the chain (`Delivered`). So after ANY node restart, reorg, mempool wipe or
// dropped payout, the books realign with reality on their own: whatever did not
// land on-chain is simply still-owed and gets re-sent. Coins are never silently
// lost, and this also auto-recovers payouts dropped before this change shipped.
//
// Double-pay is prevented by the in-flight set: a just-sent payout's gross is
// subtracted from a miner's payable balance until either its tx is seen on-chain
// (confirmed) or `confirmWindowBlocks` pass without it (dropped -> re-payable).

var chainFile string // path to the node's blocks.jsonl (co-located on the host)

// confirmWindowBlocks: a sent payout not seen on-chain within this many blocks
// is treated as dropped and becomes payable again. Long enough that a genuinely
// confirmed payout is always already counted in Delivered before we'd re-send.

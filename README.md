# Cereblix (CRB)

**A CPU-only cryptocurrency built from scratch on the self-mutating NeuroMorph
proof-of-work algorithm.** No GPU, no ASIC - ever. One CPU, one vote.

> ⚗️ Experimental software, launched in a single day with **zero premine, zero

## Why Cereblix

- **🧬 Self-mutating algorithm.** Every 4096 blocks (~2.8 days) NeuroMorph
  rebuilds its own VM semantics from chain entropy - opcode weights, program
  length, constants, AES keys all change. Fixed-function hardware for an
  algorithm that doesn't exist yet is impossible. That is lifelong ASIC
  resistance by construction, not by promise.
- **⚖️ 1 CPU = 1 vote.** Random programs with data-dependent branches starve
  GPUs (warp divergence) - any laptop competes. No farms.
- **🤝 Fair launch.** Empty genesis block, coins exist only from mining.
- **📡 Lightweight node.** One dependency-free Go binary; the chain is
  human-readable JSONL.

## Build

Requires Go 1.21+. Zero external dependencies (standard library only).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cerebra-CBR/cerebra.git
cd cereblix
go build ./...

# or build each tool:
go build -o cereblixd        ./cmd/cereblixd
go build -o cereblix-miner   ./cmd/cereblix-miner
go build -o cereblix-wallet  ./cmd/cereblix-wallet
```

Cross-compile (e.g. Windows from Linux):

```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o cereblix-miner.exe ./cmd/cereblix-miner
```

## Mine

```sh
# 1. create a wallet address
cereblix-wallet new main

# 2. point the miner at any node (the public seed by default)
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS            # uses all cores
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS -threads 4 # limit cores
```

> Antivirus software often flags unsigned CPU miners as PUA - add an exclusion
> for the miner file rather than disabling protection.

## Run a full node

```sh
cereblixd -datadir ./data                       # follow the chain
cereblixd -datadir ./data -mine -threads 2 -coinbase crb1YOURADDRESS  # node + miner
```

Your own node's RPC is at `http://127.0.0.1:18751/api`. Point the wallet/miner
at it with `-node http://127.0.0.1:18751/api`.

## Standalone CLI wallet

A local key store + RPC client + block explorer, independent of the website
(like `bitcoin-cli`). Keys live only on your machine in `~/.cereblix/wallet.json`
(optionally passphrase-encrypted with PBKDF2 + AES-GCM).

```sh
cereblix-wallet                      # interactive shell
cereblix-wallet new main             # create address
cereblix-wallet list                 # addresses + balances
cereblix-wallet send crb1... 12.5    # sign locally, broadcast
cereblix-wallet encrypt              # passphrase-protect the wallet
cereblix-wallet tx <txid>            # explorer: look up a transaction
cereblix-wallet block 42             # explorer: show a block
cereblix-wallet richlist             # top addresses
```

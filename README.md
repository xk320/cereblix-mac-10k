## Why Cereblix

- **🧬 Self-mutating algorithm.** Every 4096 blocks (~2.8 days) NeuroMorph
  rebuilds its own VM semantics from chain entropy - opcode weights, program
  length, constants, AES keys all change. Fixed-function hardware for an
  algorithm that doesn't exist yet is impossible. That is lifelong ASIC
  resistance by construction, not by promise.
- **⚖️ 1 CPU = 1 vote.** Random programs with data-dependent branches starve
  GPUs (warp divergence) - any laptop competes. No farms.
- **🤝 Fair launch.** Empty genesis block, coins exist only from mining.
- **📡 Lightweight node.** One dependency-free Go binary; the chain is
  human-readable JSONL.

## Build

**Prebuilt binaries** (node, miner, wallet — Linux/Windows/macOS) are on the
[latest release](https://github.com/Cereblix/cereblix/releases/latest).

To build from source — requires Go 1.21+, zero external dependencies (standard
library only):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cereblix/cereblix.git
cd cereblix
go build ./...

# or build each tool:
go build -o cereblixd        ./cmd/cereblixd
go build -o cereblix-miner   ./cmd/cereblix-miner
go build -o cereblix-wallet  ./cmd/cereblix-wallet
```

Cross-compile (e.g. Windows from Linux):

```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o cereblix-miner.exe ./cmd/cereblix-miner
```

## Mine

```sh
# 1. create a wallet address
cereblix-wallet new main

# 2. point the miner at any node (the public seed by default)
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS            # uses all cores
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS -threads 4 # limit cores
```

> Antivirus software often flags unsigned CPU miners as PUA - add an exclusion
> for the miner file rather than disabling protection.

### Mine in a browser (phone / iOS / Android / desktop)

The NeuroMorph hasher also compiles to WebAssembly, so the coin can be mined in
any browser with no install and no signing - including iOS Safari and Android.
It is much slower than the native miner (a phone does a few to a few dozen H/s)
but runs anywhere. Open `mine.html` on the site, enter your address, start.

Build the wasm module:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o web/site/cereblix.wasm ./cmd/cereblix-wasm
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" web/site/wasm_exec.js
```

Hashing is verified byte-identical across amd64, arm64 and wasm
(`TestCrossPlatformHash`), so browser/phone-found blocks are accepted.

### Mine in a pool (steady rewards)

Solo mining is a lottery; a pool pays a steady trickle proportional to your work.
The stock miner works against the pool unchanged - just point `-node` at it:

```sh
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS -node https://cereblix.com/pool/api
```

On the pool the miner logs `share accepted` - those are *shares* (proofs of work
at an easier target), not full blocks; your real reward arrives as automatic pool
payouts to your address. Each share is cryptographically bound to your address
(per-miner extranonce), so no one can claim your work.

**🇷🇺 RU / CIS:** if `cereblix.com` is slow or blocked for you (Cloudflare
throttling), mine through our Moscow relay node instead - same chain, same pool,
same payouts, just a direct route with no Cloudflare in the way:

```sh
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS -node https://ru.cereblix.com/pool/api   # pool
cereblix-miner -addr crb1YOURADDRESS -node https://ru.cereblix.com/api        # solo
```

### Free faucet

No coins yet? Grab a little from the faucet to try the wallet. The anti-bot check
is a real in-browser NeuroMorph **share** (your CPU mines for a moment), so it
doubles as a tiny mining onramp: https://cereblix.com/faucet.html

## Run a full node

```sh
cereblixd -datadir ./data                       # follow the chain
cereblixd -datadir ./data -mine -threads 2 -coinbase crb1YOURADDRESS  # node + miner
```

Your own node's RPC is at `http://127.0.0.1:18751/api`. Point the wallet/miner
at it with `-node http://127.0.0.1:18751/api`.

**Self-updating.** The node keeps itself current automatically: every ~20 min it
fetches an **authority-signed** release manifest (GitHub first, `cereblix.com`
fallback), verifies the SHA-256, swaps the binary and restarts - with automatic
rollback if an update fails to come up healthy, so a bad release can't brick it.
Turn it off per node with `cereblixd -autoupdate off`; check state with
`cereblixd -diagnose`; force a check with `cereblixd -update`. This is how network
upgrades roll out without manual coordination.

**Fees** are a tiny flat anti-spam floor (~0.00001 CRB); under load blocks fill
**highest-fee-first** (pay a bit more to confirm sooner), so the mempool never
stalls. The wallet auto-suggests a fee from current network load.

## Standalone CLI wallet

A local key store + RPC client + block explorer, independent of the website
(like `bitcoin-cli`). Keys live only on your machine in `~/.cereblix/wallet.json`
(optionally passphrase-encrypted with PBKDF2 + AES-GCM).

```sh
cereblix-wallet                      # interactive shell
cereblix-wallet new main             # create address
cereblix-wallet list                 # addresses + balances
cereblix-wallet send crb1... 12.5    # sign locally, broadcast
cereblix-wallet encrypt              # passphrase-protect the wallet
cereblix-wallet tx <txid>            # explorer: look up a transaction
cereblix-wallet block 42             # explorer: show a block
cereblix-wallet richlist             # top addresses
```
